A dPPM signal looks like this:

______   _   _      _   _________
      | | | | |    | | |
      |_| |_| |____| |_|
  
  Where it rests HIGH when idle
  and the signal is the length of the LOW gaps between the short HIGH spikes.
  
  To measure this, we need three interrupts:
  1) A Falling Edge interrupt to detect the start of a gap
  2) A Rising Edge interrupt to detect the end of a gap
  3) A Timeout interrupt to distinguish between a spike and the end of signal (return to idle).
  
  The code, after initializing whatever variables are needed, will enter an event loop
  where it handles the interrupts as follows:
  
  FALLING EDGE
  cancel timeout.
  Begin a timer.
  
  RISING EDGE
  Begin timeout.
  Stop timer.
  if timer > some threshold, store a 0, otherwise store a 1
  
  TIMEOUT
  Save signal packet
  Reset to initial conditions.
  if time allows, decode packet as well.
